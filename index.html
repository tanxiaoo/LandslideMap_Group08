                Landslides are one of the most widespread and devastating
                geohazards in the world. Landslide susceptibility mapping is a
                key preliminary step in risk mitigation strategies.
                Susceptibility maps depict the spatial probability levels for a
                certain area to be prone to landslides, based on local
                environmental variables. A second key step is exposure
                assessment which implies counting (or estimating) of people,
                property, systems, or other elements present in hazard zones.

                <h3>Hazard, exposure and vulnerability principles</h3>
              </header>
              <p>
                Hazard is a process, phenomenon or human activity that may cause
                loss of life, injury or other health impacts, property damage,
                social and economic disruption or environmental degradation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Exposure is defined as “the situation of people, infrastructure,
                housing, production capacities and other tangible human assets
                located in hazard-prone areas”. As stated in the UNIDRR
                glossary, “measures of exposure can include the number of people
                or types of assets in an area. These can be combined with the
                specific vulnerability and capacity of the exposed elements to
                any particular hazard to estimate the quantitative risks
                associated with that hazard in the area of interest”. Exposure
                can be assessed by overlaying susceptibility maps with the
                spatial density layers of those elements within the considered
                areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                Vulnerability The conditions determined by physical, social,
                economic and environmental factors or processes which increase
                the susceptibility of an individual, a community, assets or
                systems to the impacts of hazards.
